# [Apache T U R B I N E](https://turbine.apache.org/)

Turbine Build is a collection of the main components provided as modules to build and deploy.

## U S A G E 

Apache Turbine components are:

- Core: The Turbine Web Framework 
- Parent: The Parent POM for all Turbine/Fulcrum components
- Site: The Turbine Wrapper Site
- Archetypes: The Turbien Archetype Generator Source

You can find more here: [Apache Turbine](https://turbine.apache.org/).

## B U I L D I N G

You must have Maven 3.x

Building the Turbine from GIT is very easy.  Turbine has been
Maven-enabled.  Please refer to the Maven Getting Started document for
instructions on building.  This document is available here:

https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/

### GIT 

Turbine Build does use (Git Submodules)[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules].

Find more detailed information (here)[README_TECHNICAL_GITMODULES.md].

You could use git to checkout current trunk:

     git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/apache/turbine-build.git 
     
If you did a normal clone you have to init the submodules from the root folder with

    git submodule update --init --recursive
    
This will register and clone all submodules in one step.
     
Hint: To limit history e.g. to 10 commits add --depth 10.
     
To update all submodules: 

     git pull --recurse-submodules 
     
or equivalently:

    git submodule update --init --remote 
    
    git submodule sync
    
or:
    git submodule foreach git pull
     
To init or merge and fast-forward a single module:

    git submodule update --init --remote <module>
    
or later
    
    git submodule update --remote --merge <module>
    
or change into submodule

    cd <submodule>
    git checkout master
    git pull
    
After having done this, check with

    git status
    
and add the changed submodules (untracked contents, new commits" :

    git add <submodule>
    git commit "updated submodule <>"
    
## Documentation

Turbine Core documenttion is found [here](https://turbine.apache.org/).

## Requirements

Turbine requires Java 11 since v5.2 and Java 8 (since v4).

### Publishing Workflow

#### Prerequisites

Deploy jars
 
    mvn deploy -Papache-release

More Information:
  - [Maven Component Reference](http://maven.apache.org/developers/website/deploy-component-reference-documentation.html)
  - [Apache Release Publishing](https://infra.apache.org/publishing-maven-artifacts.html)
  
##### Steps


1. Local Testing

Verify gpg.homedir, gpg.useagent, gpg.passphrase. Check, if -Dgpg.useagent=false is needed,  see below comment to pinentry.
You may need to add additional profiles, e.g. -Papache-release,java8 or add -Dgpg.passphrase=<xx> 

    
    mvn clean site install -Papache-release 
  

If dependency check is skipped by default, do mvn org.owasp:dependency-check-maven:check -Ddependency.check.skip=false
Since Turbine Parent 8 security check is enabled by default.

    mvn release:prepare -DdryRun=true -Papache-release -Dtag=<project.artifact>-<version>-candidate
    
Here the tag is already set.

And finally:

    mvn release:clean    

2. Remote Testing


As we using GIT as SCM, be sure that you execute the steps in the *master|trunk|main* branch as GIT commands are applied to the current branch.

Find more Information in [Turbine Release Manual](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TURBINE/Publishing+a+Release).

If you have not set ssh-key or gpg authentication,  the tasks may require that you explicitely authenticate with -Dusername=<username> -Dpassword=<pw>. 


Important: Success will be on the master build, the others are skipped.


    mvn release:prepare -Papache-release -Dtag=<project.artifact>-<version>-candidate

  
3. Release Preparing

If you get a 401 error on the upload to repository.apache.org, make sure
that your mvn security settings are in place ~/.m2/settings.xml and ~/.m2/settings-security.xml 

For more information on setting up security see the encryption guide:
 - [GUIDE ENCRYPTION](http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html).

This performs an upload to https://repository.apache.org/#stagingRepositories

Hint: Add -Dgpg.useagent=false helps, if running from a windows machine to avoid hanging while gpg plugin signing process 
 .. this may happen, if you do not define the pinentry-program in gpg-agent.conf correctly ..

    mvn release:perform
  
You could find more information here: [Book Reference Staging](http://www.sonatype.com/books/nexus-book/reference/staging.html)
  
4. Close the staging

Login and close in Nexus Repo:

 - [Staging](https://repository.apache.org/index.html#stagingRepositories)
 
 More information available: [CLOSE STAGE](https://www.apache.org/dev/publishing-maven-artifacts.html#close-stage).
 
 Fetch the URL for the tagged Repo from target/checkout with
  
    git pull --prune --tags
    git tag -l 
    git checkout <tag>
    
You will be in detached mode.    
  
5. Prepare Voting Information and Voting
 
 ....
  
6. Either Promote / Publish or Drop and Restage

  - [PROMOTE INFO](http://www.apache.org/dev/publishing-maven-artifacts.html#promote)
  - [DROP INFO](http://www.apache.org/dev/publishing-maven-artifacts.html#drop)
  
6a Promote / Release

- Release staged repository in nexus

- Rename (replace) the GIT tag <xyz>-candidate to <xyz>. 
Find more Information in [Turbine Release Manual](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TURBINE/Publishing+a+Release).

- Proceed with next step.

  
6b Revert

- Drop "reverse merge" the release prepare. If backup files (from release:prepare) are still there:

    mvn release:rollback

which will delete the tag in git repo tag and revert to the pre-release state.

Otherwise reset the commit in master in your checked out trunk/master/main branch 

    git reflog
    // find commit previous to release
    git reset â€“hard <shacommit>
    git push -f origin master

and update master repo and delete the tag manually.

    git push origin :refs/tags/<project.artifact>-<version>-candidate

- Drop staged repository in nexus and start again with step 1.

- Don't forget to refer to the failed vote Message-ID in the commit messages (git, nexus).

After changing, what was missing, refer to the reason in the commit message.

    git commit "Reset RC to state previous RC due to <Message-ID>"


 
7. Distribution 

  - (http://www.apache.org/dev/release#upload-ci),
  - http://www.apache.org/dev/release.html#host-GA and 
  - http://www.apache.org/dev/release-publishing.html#distribution
  
  
  - Update branch asf-site in Turbine component root: Copy files from target/staging to the root of branch asf-site and commit.
  This will trigger (with .asf.yaml configuration) an update to the distribution site.
  
  - SVN checkout target distribution from https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/turbine/<...>/<...>
  - GIT checkout GIT_REPO <foo>-<version>-candidate
    Find more onformation in [Wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TURBINE/Publishing+a+Release)
  - Generate artifacts (check local repo and target for artifacts) from released version
 
Checkout the tagged released release and run:
 
    mvn clean install package -Papache-release 

 
Generate checksums with UNIX tool shasum (2022 at least sha512), Windows certutil or other tools and 
copy artifacts and sha-files to the distribution folder dist source/binaries folder.

If not all jars are included (assembly plugin _SHOULD_ run after jar generation), run a second time without clean.
If no sha512 files are in the target folder, check local repo.
      
- SVN Add <binaries>, <sources> artifacts (jar/zip/tar.gz,asc,sha512 files) to target repo.
- SVN Remove old releases binaries and sources 

 After repos/dist is updated an automatic email will be generated, if no update of the release database is done:
  
 - [ADD TO TURBINE RELEASE APACHE](https://reporter.apache.org/addrelease.html?turbine)
   

 8.  Stage the latest documentation 

- [DEPLOY DOCU](http://maven.apache.org/developers/website/deploy-component-reference-documentation.html)

## Git Checkout <tagged release version> source. Generate and Publish Site

Find an overview about the technical structure of the sites (here)[README_SITE_STRUCTURE.md].

### Short description of the process using asf-site branch using GIT commands

Hint: If checking out the branch asf-site you find an .asf.yaml file, where the exact configuration is found, what happens after site generation.

Find more information [here](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/git+-+.asf.yaml+features).

- Generate the site in master branch and optionally save it somewhere


    mvn site


- Save target/site or target/staging into another folder (target may be ignored, but to be sure)

- checkout branch asf-site. Verify proper settings in .asf.yaml providing at least this line:

    whoami: asf-site

- Copy content of saved copy or target/site (single module) to *the root of the branch*

- Commit and push (this triggers the site update, if not contact INFRA)

### ~~Maven Publishing~~

The second steps are not yet tested with GIT repos (2021). Use instead the workflow above (using GIT commands). 

Omit site:stage, which reqires site element definition in distributionManagement

    mvn site scm-publish:publish-scm -Dscmpublish.dryRun=true
    mvn clean site scm-publish:publish-scm -Dusername=<username> -Dpassword=<pw>

### Deployment 
   
To deploy the site execute

    mvn site-deploy

IMPORTANT: You may have to clean up the checkoutDirectory of maven-scm-publish-plugin plugin after doing a dry run!
This directory is configured in turbine-parent by default outside target folder:

    turbine.site.cache: ${user.home}/turbine-sites
    
Check pom.xml configuration of properties.
